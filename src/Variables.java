public class Variables {
    /*
        Variables are containers to store data in memory. Each variable has a name, type and value. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. Java has 4 types of variables.
        Local Variables: Declared inside a method, constructor, or block. Accessible only within that block.
        Instance Variables: Declared inside a class but outside any method. Each object of the class has its own copy.
        Static Variables: Declared with the static keyword inside a class. Shared by all objects of the class.
        Final Variables: Declared with final keyword. Value cannot be changed once assigned

        | Feature           | Instance Variable                      | Static Variable                   |
        | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
        | Belongs to        | Object (instance of class)             | Class itself                      |
        | Memory Allocation | Created each time an object is created | Single copy shared by all objects |
        | Accessed By       | Through object reference               | Class name (preferred) or object  |
        | Lifetime          | Exists as long as the object exists    | Exists till the program ends      |
        | Example Usage     | rollNo, name of student                | college name, company name        |
